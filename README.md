GSynergy React Web Challenge â€“ A Two Page React Web App

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installing all the dependencies of the app in the development mode.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `Overview`
This app contains Home Page that shows all the latest movies.
User can search for a specific movie using the searchbar at the top of the page.
User can view the details of movies by clicking on the movie card.
Movie detail page consist of details about the movies like.
User can view this application mobile as well. It is fully responsive.

I have handled the listing of movies and search functionality gracefully and implemented debouncing while searching the movies which reduces expensive API calls at Home.js

If I would have been provided with more time I would have opted to further optimize the build and function calls.
